# Chapter 4 â€” Global Information Sharing

**Aim**  
To assess the performance of introducing global information sharing into a traditionally distributed swarm, by systematically varying task and swarm parameters.

**Findings**  
- Introduced a central database method for sharing information in a swarm logistics task.  
- Demonstrated that even minimal global information improved task completion speed.  
- Systematic experiments across swarm sizes and task complexities revealed **clear trade-offs** between bandwidth use and performance gains.  

**Contributions**  
- First controlled study of adding global information to a distributed swarm in a logistics context.  
- Provided empirical evidence that small amounts of shared information can meaningfully accelerate swarm performance.  
- Established a benchmark method for database-mediated information sharing.
