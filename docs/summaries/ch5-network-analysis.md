# Chapter 5 â€” Network Analysis

**Aim**  
To evaluate the real-world characteristics of a cloud-based collective knowledge base, and to examine how infrastructure-network variations affect the task performance of a simulated hybrid swarm.

**Findings**  
- Measured latency, throughput, and response times using a MongoDB cloud-hosted database.  
- Captured systematic variations across Wi-Fi and 4G/5G networks.  
- Applied measured latencies to both simulations and physical robot experiments, showing **degradation patterns** linked to network conditions.  

**Contributions**  
- First quantitative link between **real-world infrastructure networks** and swarm performance via a cloud database.  
- Highlighted bandwidth and latency as key constraints for scaling hybrid swarms.  
- Provided actionable guidelines for deploying cloud-based collective knowledge bases in robotics.
