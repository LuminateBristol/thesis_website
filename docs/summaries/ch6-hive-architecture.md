# Chapter 6 â€” The Hive Architecture

**Aim**  
To develop a formalised architecture for the hybrid swarm framework and systematically test said framework under a range of tasks, swarm configurations, and network variations.

**Findings**  
- Introduced the **Hive Architecture**, a generalised framework for hybrid swarms.  
- Defined **Layer 0** (local swarm autonomy) and **Layer 1** (optional global information via Hive).  
- Tested the architecture across multiple tasks, swarm sizes, and degraded networks, confirming its robustness and adaptability.  

**Contributions**  
- First formalised architecture for hybrid swarm robotics.  
- Demonstrated generalisability across tasks and network conditions.  
- Provided a foundation for future hybrid swarm research, balancing **distributed autonomy** with **cloud-enabled capability**.
