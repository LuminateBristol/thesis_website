# Chapter 7 â€” Automatic Information Selection

**Aim**  
To assess the self-optimisation capabilities of the Hive through two automatic information methods.

**Findings**  
- Implemented and tested two approaches:
  - **Greedy selection**: simple threshold-based prioritisation.  
  - **Evolutionary selection**: genetic algorithm evolving weights for information nodes.  
- Both methods reduced bandwidth while maintaining or improving task performance.  
- Evolutionary optimisation consistently outperformed greedy selection in dynamic conditions.  

**Contributions**  
- Demonstrated that the Hive can autonomously optimise what information to share.  
- Provided the first evidence of **self-learning information selection** in a hybrid swarm.  
- Showed scalability of evolutionary optimisation for thousands of nodes and large swarms.
